Write a C/C++ program that consist of several modules:
- A class/struct defining the "Complex" number (in a separate source and header files) supporting basic operations (+, -, multiply by constant, absolute value)
- If implementing in C++ using classes use methods and operator overloads, if using plain c syntax, just define functions that do the operations
- Implement a sorting algorithm (any) that will sort an array of complex numbers by their absolute value
- A "main.cpp" or "main.c" file demonstrating your sorting algorithm in action (array/list of complex numbers ordered by absolute value)

Then, a Makefile should be written to build this modules together (a target per each module).
Makefile should support:
- Target "all" and "clean"
- Compiler, Compiler flags should be given by Makefile variables

Submissions should be placed into a Github (or Bitbucket) repository. All other submissions will not be considered.
