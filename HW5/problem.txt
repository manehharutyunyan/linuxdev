Pipe Communication

Write a program that gets from outside a number N (N > 1 000 000), creates an array of size N and fills it with random integer numbers. 
After that program should calculate the sum of array this way:
- Get from outside another number M that would be the number of parallel workers to calculate the sum
- Every parallel worker is a child process. Each process should take two indexes i and j, calculate sub-total sum of array from i to j and return the calculated number to parent.
- Every child process should also print the sub-total value (part of sum it calculated).
- All M processes should work in parallel and parent should wait them all
- After all the child processes completed calculation, the parent process should get all the sub-total values and calculate the final sum, and then, print the total summary.

Requirement: Parent and child communication should be implemented with pipes. Communication includes sending start and end index from parent to child as well as sending sub total from child to parent.

Pay attention to coding style and comments.
