Signal handling

Write a program that runs an infinite loop. Inside the loop put some delays (sleeps) for some seconds (ex: 10).
Register a signal handler for the signal SIGUSR1 which interrupts the execution and prints the following information:
- The PID of the sender
- The UID and the User Name of the sender
- The current values of following registers EIP, EAX, EBX (more if you wish)

Hint: Look at third argument of signal handler.

Requirement: Write a Makefile for the program. Keep code simple and clean.

Pay attention to coding style and comments.
